Introduction
This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a turbo pump using SolidWorks. Turbo pumps are high-performance pumps used in various industrial applications to move fluids at high pressures. The project covers the complete design process, from initial concept to final analysis, using SolidWorks for 3D modeling and simulation.

Features
3D modeling of turbo pump components
Assembly of turbo pump
Simulation and analysis of pump performance
Detailed design report
Requirements
To work with this project, you will need the following software:

SolidWorks (version 2020 or later)
SolidWorks Simulation add-in (for analysis)
A computer capable of running SolidWorks

Usage
Design Files
The design files for the turbo pump are located in the design directory. This includes all part files (.SLDPRT) and the assembly file (.SLDASM).

Simulation
The simulation setup and results are included in the simulation directory. Open the simulation study in SolidWorks to view the analysis and results.

Report
A detailed report explaining the design process, simulation methodology, and results is provided in the report.docx file. Open the report using any compatible word processor.

Example Workflow
Open the turbo pump assembly file (turbo_pump_assembly.SLDASM) in SolidWorks.
Review and modify the part designs as needed.
Set up a new simulation study or review the existing simulation study in the simulation directory.
Run the simulation to analyze the pump performance.
Review the simulation results and make necessary design adjustments.
Document your findings in the provided report template.
